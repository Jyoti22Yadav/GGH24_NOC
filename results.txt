Explanation:
This sample result file shows the average reward obtained by the RL agent after every 50 episodes during training.
The rewards are negative in the beginning as the agent is learning, but they improve over time as the agent learns an optimal policy.
You can update this file with the actual results obtained during your RL agent training.
